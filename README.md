# UVA SIWIF Simulation of Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering

This simulation is designed to run on Oculus hardware. If you have an Oculus Rift, you simply need to download the application and run it on your computer. 

For Oculus Quest and Go, you'll need to follow a few mildly laborious steps. (Eventually we'll have the simulation in the Oculus Store, which will be simpler.)
