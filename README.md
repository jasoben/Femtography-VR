# UVA SIWIF Simulation of Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering

This simulation is designed to run on Oculus hardware. Currently this includes Oculus Quest and Oculus Rift. (Oculus Go support and Vive support coming soon!)

## Oculus Rift

Simply download the application package and run it on your computer. [https://github.com/jasoben/Femtography-VR/blob/master/Downloads/RiftBuild.zip]

## Oculus Quest

For Oculus Quest, you'll need to follow a few mildly laborious steps. (Eventually we'll have the simulation in the Oculus Store, which will be simpler.) 

### Step 1 - Follow Instructions for Installing SideQuest

SideQuest allows you to easily load applications onto your Oculus Mobile hardware, after you complete the setup as written here: https://sidequestvr.com/#/setup-howto 

### Step 2 - Load the APK onto Your Device

Send the APK to your device by dragging and dropping it into SideQuest. [https://github.com/jasoben/Femtography-VR/blob/master/Downloads/dvcsSimulation.apk]

### Step 3 - Look for the Software under Library -> Unknown Sources

You'll find the simulation listed under Library -> Unknown Sources
