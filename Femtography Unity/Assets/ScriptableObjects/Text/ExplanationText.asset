  - "Welcome to the FemtoNET Explorer. We begin our journey floating in VERY SMALL
    SPACE. You'll notice that geometry gets a bit... wobbly down here, which is why
    our coordinate plane is shifting around like a mildly turbulent sea. Particles
    flit in and out of existence due to WEIRD QUANTUM WEIRDNESS. \r\n\r\nPress \"Initialize\"
    to begin."
  - "We load in an electron and, in the distance, a particle detector. (These are
    not simulated to scale-- in reality the detector is SIGNIFICANTLY larger; if
    the electron were a baseball, the detector would be the size of the earth.) \r\n\r\nPress
    \"Launch\" to send the electron into the detector."
  - 'The electron fires into the detector and... something is detected. Let''s follow
    it and see where it goes.

    

    Check "Follow Particles" and then "Launch"
    another.'
  - 'When the electron is near to the proton, it releases a high-energy photon. The
    photon continues towards the proton, while the electron is deflected.

    

    Click
    "Play" when you''re ready to see the next step.'
  - "The photon collides with the proton and the proton is both deflected and charged
    with energy from the photon. \r\n\r\nClick \"Play\" when you're ready to see
    the next step."
  - 'The proton releases a high-energy photon a few moments later to shed the excess
    energy. The proton and the high-energy photon are then both detected by the detector.

    

    Click
    "Play" when you''re ready to see the next step.'
  - 'Try adjusting the sliders. As you increase q^2 (aka momentum transfer), we are
    able to see more of the interior of the proton. Quarks and anti-quarks come in
    and out of existence. This is just an illustration of the process-- to learn
    how we actually "see" the interior of the proton, visit the museum exhibit on
    "Interference Patterns".

    

    You can also speed up or slow down the
    simulation with the speed slider.

    

    Try turning off "Follow Particle"
    to watch the particles from your current vantage point.

    

    Finally,
    use the teleport button to change your vantage point.'
