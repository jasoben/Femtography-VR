Welcome to the FemtoNET Explorer. We begin our journey floating in VERY SMALL SPACE. You'll notice that geometry gets a bit... wobbly down here, which is why our coordinate plane is shifting around like a mildly turbulent sea. Particles flit in and out of existence due to WEIRD QUANTUM WEIRDNESS. 

Press "Initialize" to begin.

We load in an electron and, in the distance, a particle detector. (These are not simulated to scale-- in reality the detector is SIGNIFICANTLY larger; if the electron were a baseball, the detector would be the size of the earth.) 

Press "Launch" to send the electron into the detector.

The electron fires into the detector and... something is detected. Let's follow it and see where it goes.

Check "Follow Particles" and then "Launch" another.
